# AngularAppTemplate
A basic template for a small/medium sized Angular.js project

-Angular.js 1.3.15 is installed.

-All a simple module and main controller are setup. You just need to change the names to suit your project.

-ng-cloak is installed in CSS and ready to use.

-This template uses SASS.


I created this for myself to save a tiny bit of time starting new Angular projects, but feel free to download and use it for your own purposes.
